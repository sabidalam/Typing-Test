                        <P><b>Global scope:</b> <br>
                            The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global
                            variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from
                            any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.
                            It is not a good practice to use global variables when they are not needed as every code
                            block will have access to those variables.
                        </P>
                        <p><b>Block scope:</b> <br>
                            Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope
                            of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or
                            conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables
                            from within the curly brackets {}.The keywords let and const are used to define block
                            variables.We created a block-scoped local variable enclosed within curly brackets {} by
                            using the keyword let.

                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p>
                            JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing
                            the
                            code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.Event loop is an
                            endless loop, which waits for tasks, executes them and then sleeps until it receives more
                            tasks. <br>
                            The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the
                            Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push
                            it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.

                            Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function
                            callback.
                            The event loop executes the tasks starting from the oldest first.

                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p> Let's see some ways that will give us undefine in javascript - <br>
                            1. Variable that is not initialized will give undefined.<br>
                            2. Function with no return will give undefined.<br>
                            3. Parameter that is not passed will give undefined.<br>
                            4. If return has nothing on the right side will return undefined.<br>
                            5. Property that doesn't exists in an object will give undefined.<br>
                            6. If we try to access array elements outside of the index range will us undefined.<br>
                            7. Deleting an element inside an array.<br>
                            8. Set a value directly to undefined.
